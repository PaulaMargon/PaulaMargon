## Welcome to the jungle!

Welcome to my Github profile, my name is Paula, and I live in the Fortunate Island  ( Spain ), although many times I live in my worlds.

I am a Web Application Design student, and I hope in the not too distant future to work in this field because I love and am passionate about discovering new things. However, at first, it can be overwhelming (And the world of programming isðŸ˜„).

In my training, I have mostly used `HTML5 & CSS3`, `Javascript, PHP, Java, and C#`, although I would like to learn more C# and explore `Laravel`. I say this, although I have purchased several `Angular`, and `Python` courses along the way. I'm still settling in and exploring what I like the most.

To finish and mention something about me... I am very fond of *videogames*, *technology*, and *reading*. I have studied criminology, a bit of psychology, and on my CMS like `Joomla` during these years.

However, what I did the most during this time was to create content on my Youtube channel, talking about Indie games, AAA, and in general, countless video games and technological issues. The channel reached more than 150,000 views, and to stand out although I had to stay away from the media spotlight for a few years.
Although it continues to be one of my passions, my current goal is different.

Here, I'll show you some of the projects I'm working on to learn and practice!
